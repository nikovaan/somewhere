# Just putting it somewhere
This repository is a collection of my own programming from various projects. Some of the code has been cleaned up and refactored from how it was, not all though.
See each folder's readme for details on what they were. TODO: come back here after writing those.

Everything here was 100% written by me.

License: none of this is licensed for any kind of use by people who aren't me. TODO: change to GPL.
